# alt text bot consent

**opt in:** add `<!-- altbot:opt-in -->` to your user “about me” or your community’s description.

**opt out:** just remove that line. changes happen right away, but won’t stop anything already started.

**when do i generate alt text?**

- **automatically:** when you post, but only if both *you* and *the community* have opted in.
- **manually:** if someone comments `@alttextbot` on your post, and you’ve opted in.
